#  INTRODUCTION TO CLOUD COMPUTING(AWS)  

**What is cloud Computing ?**     
  * The cloud computing is to offers faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale    
  * The cloud computing is to deliverd various cloud sevices like Networking, Scaling, Storage, Databases, Softwere and analytices & Intaligence  

**Benefits of Cloud Computing**  
  * Cost Saving  
  * Loss Prevension  
  * Increased Collaboration  
  * Centralized DATA Security  
  * Scalability  
  * Quality Control

**Disadvantages of cloud computing**  
  * Downtime  
     * When there is an internet outage or weak connectivity, services get interrupted and this increases downtime.   
  * Security and Privacy  
     * Cloud security measures lead to data leakage over cloud networks which can result in intellectual property theft, contract breaches, and malware attacks.  
  * Vulnerability to Attacks  
     * As these clouds provide services to multiple users over the same network, businesses become vulnerable to cyber attacks which can lead to data loss or data leakage.   
  * Vendor Lock-in  
     * A situation where companies using cloud computing services of a particular vendor are unable to switch to a different vendor.  
  * Cost Concerns  
     * It can also increase expenditure for companies as there are several hidden costs involved which emerge at a later stage. These include data transfer, cloud utilization, and data migration costs.
   
**TYPES OF CLOUD**  
 * PRIVATE
    * Private clouds are distributed systems that work on private infrastructure and provide the users with dynamic provisioning of computing resources.  
 * PUBLICE
    * Public clouds are managed by third parties which provide cloud services over the internet to the public, these services are available as pay-as-you-go billing models.   
 * HYBRID
    * A hybrid cloud is a heterogeneous distributed system formed by combining facilities of the public cloud and private cloud.
